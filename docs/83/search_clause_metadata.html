Using Search Clauses</h1>
<p>Search clauses may be used with <a class="el" href="class_h_p_1_1_h_p_t_r_i_m_1_1_s_d_k_1_1_trim_main_object_search.html">TrimMainObjectSearch</a> either via the <a class="el" href="class_h_p_1_1_h_p_t_r_i_m_1_1_s_d_k_1_1_trim_search_clause.html">TrimSearchClause</a> class or as strings via <a class="el" href="class_h_p_1_1_h_p_t_r_i_m_1_1_s_d_k_1_1_trim_main_object_search.html#a81aac5c5f4b723e4d3e3cb6211e5da1b">TrimMainObjectSearch.SetSearchString</a>. Given that search clauses may be captioned it is a good idea when using them as strings to use their internal name. This document lists all search clauses along with their internal names.</p>
<h2>Interrogating metadata</h2>
<p>The information about search clauses, like much of the CM metadata, is available via the SDK. In this case we can use the <a class="el" href="class_h_p_1_1_h_p_t_r_i_m_1_1_s_d_k_1_1_search_clause_def.html">SearchClauseDef</a> to get information about each search clause. This Powershell script was used to build the table below.</p>
